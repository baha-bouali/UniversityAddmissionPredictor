# University Admission Predictor

This project predicts whether a student is likely to be placed or not based on various academic and demographic factors. The predictor utilizes a machine learning model that takes several input variables and provides a prediction of the student's placement status.

## Introduction

The University Admission Predictor is a machine learning project designed to help students and administrators predict whether a student is likely to be placed in a job or not based on various academic and personal attributes. The model considers factors such as academic performance, educational background, work experience, and other related data.

## Features

- Predict placement likelihood based on multiple input factors.
- Uses machine learning algorithms for accurate predictions.
- Easy-to-use interface for inputting student data.
- Output includes placement prediction (`Placed` or `Not Placed`).

## Technologies Used

- Python (for model development)
- Scikit-learn (for machine learning)
- Pandas and NumPy (for data handling)
- Matplotlib/Seaborn (for data visualization)
- Flask/Django (for web interface, optional)
- Jupyter Notebook (for experiments and analysis)

## How to Run the Project

1. Clone this repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/university-admission-predictor.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```
   cd university-admission-predictor
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Run the prediction model:
   - If it's a standalone script, use:
     ```
     python predict.py
     ```
   - If it's a web-based project (Flask/Django):
     ```
     flask run
     ```

5. Input the necessary data and receive the prediction.

## Input Variables

Below is a list of input variables used by the model to predict placement:

1. `sl_no`: Serial number (not used for prediction)
2. `gender`: Gender of the student (`M` for Male, `F` for Female)
3. `ssc_p`: Percentage in 10th grade (SSC)
4. `ssc_b`: SSC board of education (`Central` or `Other`)
5. `hsc_p`: Percentage in 12th grade (HSC)
6. `hsc_b`: HSC board of education (`Central` or `Other`)
7. `hsc_s`: Specialization in 12th grade (`Science`, `Commerce`, or `Arts`)
8. `degree_p`: Percentage in undergraduate degree
9. `degree_t`: Field of study in undergraduate degree (`Sci-Tech`, `Comm-Mgmt`, `Others`)
10. `workex`: Work experience (`Yes` or `No`)
11. `etest_p`: Percentage in employability test
12. `specialisation`: MBA specialization (`Mkt&Fin` or `Mkt&HR`)
13. `mba_p`: Percentage in MBA
14. `status`: Placement status (`Placed` or `Not Placed`) [Used as the target variable for training]
15. `salary`: Salary offered (used only in the prediction output for placed students)

## Usage

- **Standalone script**: Run the prediction model with input data in CSV format or manually enter student details via the command line.
  
- **Web-based interface** (Optional): You can develop a web-based interface using Flask or Django to allow users to enter data through a form and receive predictions online.
